New in 4.3
----------

No big structural changes.

- We now only use the Varnish Book (all slides). Course-specific chapters
  start out with a big bold notice about it.
- Several clarifications and rephrases throughout the book.
- Mention Anders Berg and the VML in the introduction. See
  http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/ for VML-info.
- VCL: vcl_recv: Mention security briefly. Including security.vcl. Don't
  invest too much time to this subject.
- VCL: Switch the Accept-Encoding example with a simple device detection
  example. Note that the handout suggests sending ``Vary: User-Agent``
  /from/ varnish if you do this, to avoid confused upstream caches.
- VCL Functions: mention bereq in vcl_miss and how it can be used to remove
  X-Varnish headers from the backend request...
- Varnishlog: Add a slide for different log tags to illustrate that Tx is
  sent from varnish and Rx* received by varnish.
- Varnish Programs moved to appendix.

New in 4.2
----------
Released: Fri Apr 27 2012

No big structural changes.

- A good bit of rephrasing and clarification on details. Also reduction of
  (now) historic details.
- Getting started: Added a table of varnishlog example-tags in the handout
  to emphasise the Rx/Tx nature.
- Getting started: Added a table of interesting varnsihstat-counters to the
  handout.
- In VCL: A slide discussing the initial value of beresp.ttl (e.g:
  s-maxage/max-age/Expires).
- Tuning: Move the Param-slide up.

New in 4.1
----------
Released: Mon Mar 12 2012

Almost exclusively technical and typographic changes. Released hours after
4.0 to get a version where webdev-content is mostly OK too.

New in 4.0
----------
Released: Mon Mar 12 2012

First version to integrate the web development course, and preparing to go
public. The material in the sysadmin course is left almost untouched, save
for an added exercise and some restructuring of "Getting Started". NO ESI
IN SYSADMIN.

New chapters, only affects webdev:

- HTTP, Content Composition (ESI is merged into Content Composition)

Getting Started-changes:

- More focus on using proper mechanisms. We use "service varnish
  reload/restart" (which is the same as /etc/init.d/varnish restart, so to
  speak).
- No 'start varnishd by hand' stuff.
- Skim through the slides.

Other content changes:

- Added a single exercise to the "Cache Invalidation" chapter, based on the
  material found in material/
- Removed Streaming and GZip from "Finishing words"

WebDev changes:

- HTTP:

  The HTTP chapter discusses various cache headers. It is meant to give a
  solid overview of HTTP caching mechanisms, not only Varnish-related
  headers.

- Content Composition:

  This chapter discusses how to make a site use Varnish fully. It discusses
  Cookies in detail, Vary-vs-hash_data(), ESI, ESI and cookies and a bit of
  AJAX-magic.

Practical changes:

- Several code snippets for the new chapters are provided in the material/
  directory.
- There are now three sets of PDFs. Handout PDF and slides for webdev,
  sysadmin and tutorial. Tutorial contains all chapters.


New in 3.0
----------
Released: Mon Nov 28 2011

Big reorganization effort. Much of the content is the same, but moved
around between different chapters. Reading the TOC is a must. Skimming the
chapters with new names is strongly recommended. The gist of the changes is
that it is more task-oriented than feature-oriented.

Some specific changes(unlikely to be complete):

- Remove the "Testing your Varnish Setup" chapter (never quite what I had
  hoped)
- Split 'Programs' in two: Varnishlog+varnishstat goes in 'Getting started'
  while the rest goes in the second to last chapter (For now).
- Remove the 3.0 sub-chapter in the intro
- Move design philosophy to the introduction chapter (downplay)
- No more usemod-wiki! (It's been a while since it was actually used)
- Getting started has become bigger and the exercises are less fragmented
- Merge Tunable parameters and Architecture into one chapter
- Storage backends are now discussed in the Tuning-chapter
- VCL: Renamed from intro to basics
- VCL: A state engine sub-chapter
- VCL: Merge some of the simpler exercises together
- VCL functions: The PURGE-example is stolen by the new cache
  invalidation-chapter.
- Merge the chapter on bans and advanced VCL into "Saving the request"
- Stick streaming and gzip in 'finishing words'

In "Tuning"(new chapter):

- More general discussion of threads before parameters are introduced
  - Worker threads, the existence of special-purpose threads
- The balancing of worker threads is NOT part of the general
  thread-subchapter, but left for the old thread-param-discussion for
  practical reasons.
- Added a shmlog-chapter, just saying "put it in tmpfs" and explaining the
  I/O-issue. The tools are discussed later as usual.

In "Cache Invalidation":

- Discusses banning as before
- Discusses purge;, and points out that obj.ttl=0s is obsolete
- req.hash_always_miss
- Smart bans is a sub-chapter not just a tip.

In "Saving the request":

- The "Advanced VCL" chapter and Bans merged
- More focus on the core of Grace, including an exercise
- There's a slide for a demo, prepare!
- This might still need some work, particular with regards to timing and
  exercises.
