About the material
==================

This book is part of Varnish Software's (http://www.varnish-software.com) official training material.
The material is primarily written to be used in a classroom context.

The training material evolves constantly.
Some chapters are more developed than others.
The trainer compensates those less developed chapters with live demonstrations or more in-depth discussion.

All the VCL code examples are verified for syntax-correctness frequently (semi-automatically). 
This does not, however, guarantee that they do what they are supposed to do, only that it is correct VCL syntax.
